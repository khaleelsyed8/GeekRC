            <h3>But what is a phish?</h3>
        <p>A phish is a fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information from individuals, often through deceptive emails or messages.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="element">
            <h3>But why should I care?</h3>
        <p>You should care about phishing because falling victim to it can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and compromise of personal or sensitive information. Being aware helps you protect yourself and others from potential cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="element">
            <h3>But what can I do?</h3>
        <p>You can protect yourself from phishing by being careful with emails and messages that ask for personal information or contain links. Always verify the sender's identity before clicking or sharing any sensitive information.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="Steps">
        <h4>You can follow the steps below to identify a Phish</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Check the sender</strong>: Look at who the email is from. If you don't recognize the sender or if it seems strange, be cautious. </li>
            <li><strong>Read carefully</strong>: Look for any mistakes in the email. Phishing emails often have spelling or grammar errors.</li>   
            <li><strong>Don't click suspicious links</strong>: If an email asks you to click on a link to verify your account or something similar, hover your mouse over the link without clicking to see if the website address looks strange or unfamiliar.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid sharing personal information</strong>: Legitimate companies usually don't ask for personal information like passwords or Social Security numbers through email. Be suspicious if an email asks for this.</li>    
        </ul>
